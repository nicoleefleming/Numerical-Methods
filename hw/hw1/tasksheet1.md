### Task 6
Search the internet for sites that talk about Version Control Systems (VCS) like Github. 
Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite in your response.
#### Response 
There are many. A few of the prominant ones I have used are Microsoft TFS, PostgreSQL, Github and AWS CodeCommit. 
These systems are nice since they have a check-in process for developers. With TFS there is a check in, and a review process before the code is updated.
