# Math 4610 Tasksheet 5

## Task 1
Create a code that will search for a root of a function, 
f(x), using Newton's method. Use the problem defined in Tasksheet 4, Task 4 to test the code you write. Create a software manual entry and shared library addition for your Newton method routine. Include the example problem results in your software manual entry.

## Task 5
Create a hybrid method that will search for roots by combining the Bisection method when the approximations are too far from a root and then switches over to Newton's method when the approximations are close enough.

## Task 6
 Search the internet for sites that detail differences between the Bisection method, Newton's method, and the Secant method. Write a brief summary of what you find including the pros and cons of the methods. Your write up should be a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
