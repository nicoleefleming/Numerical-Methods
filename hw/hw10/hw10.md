# Math 4610 Numerical Methods

## Task 1
Write a routines using your shared library, or module library from Python or jar-file to implement the power method as described in class for finding the eigenvalue of largest magnitude. Try your code out on a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant 100 by 100 matrix. Document the code and results of your work in your software manual.

## Task 3
Write a routine that will compute the 1-matrix norm for a square matrix. Include a software page entry for the code and test on a matrix similar to that in the first two tasks.

## Task 5
Using the code you have written, create a code that will compute the 2-condition number of a square matrix. You should be able to use your power iteration and inverse power iteration routines from the first two tasks above. Test on a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant matrix. As usual, make an entry in your software manual for the code you have written.

## Task 6
Search the internet for sites that document instances of how condition numbers of matrices are used in computationally linear algebra. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
### Response
A condition number for a matrix and computational task measures how sensitive the answer is to perturbations(noise) in the input data and to roundoff errors made during the solution process. It is the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to smallest eigenvalue of a particular matrix. It estimates the worst-case of loss of precision. The condition number tells us how stable the process is. This is important because if it is unstable it may not produce enough accuracy to have the information be viable. In the case of machine learning, instability might mean a long computation time, or a server crashing, or not useful results.
