# Math 4610 Numerical Methods

## Task 1
Write a routines using your shared library, or module library from Python or jar-file to implement the power method as described in class for finding the eigenvalue of largest magnitude. Try your code out on a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant 100 by 100 matrix. Document the code and results of your work in your software manual.

## Task 3
Write a routine that will compute the 1-matrix norm for a square matrix. Include a software page entry for the code and test on a matrix similar to that in the first two tasks.

## Task 5
Using the code you have written, create a code that will compute the 2-condition number of a square matrix. You should be able to use your power iteration and inverse power iteration routines from the first two tasks above. Test on a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant matrix. As usual, make an entry in your software manual for the code you have written.
