# Math 4610 Tasksheet 7

## Task 1:
Write a routine to compute the solution of an upper triangular matrix. Test the code on the following matrix equation Ax=b with A=a_(i,j) and 

        
          a_(i,j)=  0, j<i
                    i+j−1, j≥i
        
Finally, set b_i=1. Hint: You should write a routine that will initialize the matrix above in a general way to use over and over in examples.

## Task 2
Do the same for a lower triangular system of equations. Create an example similar to the example in Task 1. All you need to do is transpose the matrix and leave the right hand side alone. Hint: It would be a really good idea to build code that will return the transpose of a matrix.

## Task 3
Write a routine that will produce a square matrix for testing codes in the following tasks. The input should be an integer and the output a square matrix of size 
n×n. Also, write similar, but separate routines that produce upper or lower triangular matrices as in the square matrix case. Finally, write a routine that will generate a diagonal matrix of a given size. Hint: These should be easy modifications of one another.

## Task 4
Do the same for a diagonal systems of equations. That is where
                
                a_(i,j) =    0, j≠i
                           ≠ 0, j=i
                           
As an example, choose random nonzero values for the diagonal entries to test the code. Make sure that the code is as efficient as possible.

## Task 5
Write code that will reduce a square matrix to row echelon form. You do not need to test for bad pivots or anything else. Write the code as if we know the pivots will be well behaved. Create a random matrix

## Task 6
Search the internet for sites that document the conditions on matrices that ensure we will be able to compute the solution of a linear system of equations. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
