# Math 4610 Tasksheet 7

## Task 1:
Write a routine to compute the solution of an upper triangular matrix. Test the code on the following matrix equation Ax=b with A=a_(i,j) and 

        
a_(i,j)=  0, j<i
        ⎨ i+j−1, j≥i
        
Finally, set b_i=1. Hint: You should write a routine that will initialize the matrix above in a general way to use over and over in examples.
