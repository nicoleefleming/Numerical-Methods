# Math 4610 Tasksheet 7

## Task 1:
Write a routine to compute the solution of an upper triangular matrix. Test the code on the following matrix equation
A
x
=
b
with
A
=
(
a
i
,
j
)
and
a
i
,
j
=
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
0
,
 
j
<
i
 
 
i
+
j
−
1
,
 
j
≥
i
Finally, set 
b
i
=
1
. Hint: You should write a routine that will initialize the matrix above in a general way to use over and over in examples.
