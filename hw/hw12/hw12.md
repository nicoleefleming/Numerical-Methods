# Math 4610 Numerical Methods

## Task 1
Apply OpenMP directives to your matrix-vector multiplication routine. Determine if the operation can be improved through OpenMP directives. Test on large matrices to see if the performance is improved. Document this in your software manual.

## Task 2
Use the code from Task 1 to the Jacobi iteration routine to improve performance (if possible). Use the residual vector update version of the code. You should be able to use the matrix-vector code from previous tasks to start this process. Document the work in a page in your software manual.

## Task 3
Include OpenMP in the computation of the largest (in magnitude) eigenvalue of a square matrix, 
A
. Include your work in a page in your software manual.

## Task 4
Repeat Task 3 for the inverse power method for finding the smallest (in magnitude) eigenvalue of a square matrix. Test the work on a square, diagonally-dominant, symmetric matrix and document the work in your software manual. Hint: It will likely work better if you use Jacobi iteration to solve the linear systems.

## Task 5
Combine all of the work in the past two task sheets to compute the 2-norm condition number of a square symmetric matrix. Test the code on a symmetric, diagonally dominant, square matrix of size as large as possible on your computer. There are limitations on most machines. Document your work in your software manual.

## Task 6
Find web sites that discuss the use other platforms like MPI, or OpenACC/CUDA for optimizing code on various types of hardware. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
