# Tasksheet 2

## Task 1
After deciding which programming language you will use,
write a program that provides a response like that in the "Hello World!"
output. Provide details of the compilation and execution of the code
you write. Use a suitable response for the Python line "...it's only a
bunny..."

## Task 2
Edit the main README.md file in your Math 4610 repository
    on Github using your favorite browser. This means logging on to your
    Github account, navigating to the README.md file in the math4610
    repository, and editing the file on Github. In the README.md file,
    create an introduction that describes what the repository is being
    created for and put in a link to the table of contents for the homework
    problems and a link to the software manual you will create. Do this in
    Markdown - not html.
### Response
I have edited and added the link to both of the Table of Contents. On this Table of Contents there is a link to the Software Manual Table of Contents that can be used, and vise versa.

## Task 3
Create the table of contents in a file with a name like

        toc/task_toc.md

     or something like this. After completing the tasks to this point, clone
     the repository to a local directory on a local computer using git. If you
     have already cloned the repository, use a

        koebbe% git pull

     command to pull the changes to your local copy of the repository..
### Response
I already have two Table of Contents files in my math4610 repository. One is in the homework folder, and has quick links to each tasksheet .md file. It also contains a link 
to the Software Manual table of contents. Both files are named TableofContents.md.

I have also pulled a clone of my repository.

## Task 4
Now for something completely different - write out the
    analysis for the centered difference approximation in a Taylor series
    expansions. Show that the approximation is second order.

## Task 5
Determine the order of accuracy of the central difference
    approximation of the second derivative. That is, analyze the approximation
    
         f''(x) ~= (f(x+h) - 2 f(x) + f(x-h))/(h^2)
    
    via Taylor series expansions. Write a code that approximates the second
    derivative of the function
   
         f(x) = cos(x)
    
    at the point, x=2.0. Use, h=1.0,0.5,0.1,0.01,0.001,. . . .,10^{-16}\).
    Create a table of difference values between the "exact" value of the second derivative.

## Task 6
Search the internet for information regarding finite
    difference approximations of derivatives of different orders. Give
    examples of these types of approximations. You should be able to find
    many such examples. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that
    describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
