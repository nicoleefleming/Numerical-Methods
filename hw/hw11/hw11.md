# Math 4610 Numerical Methods

## Task 1
Document how many processors are available on the computer you are using for this course. Use the OpenMP omp_get_thread_num() and the parallel directive.

## Task 2
Modify your vector and matrix addition routines to use OpenMP on the loop over the operation. Try out the code on some big problems, say 
n
=
100000
 to see how the code performs. Note that there should be no data races in a naive implementation. That is
z_i = u_i + v_i
Use the OpenMP parallel for to do the parallelization. Include documentation in your software manual for this problem. It might be a good idea to include this in its own subsection for the manual.

## Task 3
Try the same code from Task 2, but use the compiler optimization flags to try to improve efficiency. In C, the flags are shown as follows
           
           koebbe% gcc -o vecadd_01 -O1 vecadd_test.c

         
in C.

## Task 4
Optimize the matrix-matrix routine you created in an earlier task sheet. The sequential version should already be a part of your shared library or other similar repository of routines. Put in a page of documentation for the results of using this code.

## Task 5
Use OpenMP directives to optimize performance of the matrix-matrix code and compare the results of the vanilla sequential code to that of the optimization in Task 4 of this tasksheet and the inherent optimization used in Task 4.

## Task 6
Search the internet for sites that document the use of OpenMP in applications. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
